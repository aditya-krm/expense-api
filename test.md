# How to Get Started with React Native

React Native is a popular framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. Here are some steps to help you get started:

1. **Install Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install React Native CLI**: Open your terminal and run the following command to install the React Native CLI globally:
   ```
npm install -g react-native-cli
   ```

3. **Create a New Project**: Use the CLI to create a new React Native project:
   ```
npx react-native init MyNewProject
   ```

4. **Run Your Project**: Navigate into your project directory and run the application:
   ```
cd MyNewProject
npx react-native run-android   # For Android
npx react-native run-ios       # For iOS
   ```

5. **Explore the Code**: Open the project in your favorite code editor and start modifying the files in the `App.js` to see changes in real-time.

6. **Learn More**: Check out the official [React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) for more detailed instructions and resources.
